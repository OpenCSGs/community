# Contributing to CSGHub

Welcome to CSGHub and thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  

CSGHub is an open-source and trusted asset management platform for large language models (LLMs). It aims to assist users in governing assets (datasets, model files, code and etc.) involved in the lifecycle of LLMs. CSGHub provides functionality similar to a private version of Hugging Face, with asset management capabilities comparable to GitLab for source code, OpenStack Glance for virtual machine images, Harbor for container images, and Sonatype Nexus for artifacts.  

## Contribution Workflow

This project follows the "Fork & Pull Request" workflow for contributions. Direct pushes to the main repository are restricted to maintainers only.  

1. Fork this repository (<https://github.com/OpenCSGs/csghub>) to your GitHub account.  
2. Make changes in your forked repository.  
3. Create a new branch in your forked repository to save your updates, preferably based on the `main` branch.  
4. Implement your updates in the new branch.  
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting the `main` branch of the original repository.  
6. Work with maintainers through the review process.  
7. Once approved, your PR will be merged into `main`.  

To ensure high-quality contributions:  

- Maintain consistent code style.  
- Include tests for new features or improvements.  
- Provide clear, well-written documentation that other developers can easily follow.  

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a suggestion? Open an issue on our [Issues](https://github.com/OpenCSGs/csghub/issues) page.  

When creating an issue:  

- Be specific about the issue - "XY doesn't work" isn't helpful.  
- Include minimal code example that demonstrates the issue.  
- For large code blocks or logs, use `<details>` and `</details>` tags to keep issues readable. Learn more about content collapsing [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details).

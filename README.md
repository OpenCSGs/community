## Introduction

OpenCSG is an open-source and fair initiative established in 2023, dedicated to building an open community for LLMs.

OpenCSG stands for Converged resources, Software refined, and Generative LM. The 'C' represents Converged resources, indicating the integration and full utilization of hybrid resources. The 'S' stands for Software refined, signifying software that is refined by large models. The 'G' represents Generative LM, which denotes widespread, inclusive, and democratized generative large models.

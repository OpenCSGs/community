# CSGHub Special Interest Group (SIG)

Welcome to the official repository of the CSGHub Special Interest Group (SIG). We're a community dedicated to advancing CSGHub, an open-source, trusted platform for Large Language Model (LLM) asset management. Our goal is to support effective governance and management of assets involved in the lifecycle of LLMs, including datasets, model files, codes, and other essential resources.

## About CSGHub
